# Work Experience

## New Jersey Institute of Technology (Newark, NJ)

**Associate Department Chair, Informatics Department** (2023-Current)

In this role I help disseminate information, schedule courses, complete accreditation requirements, evaluate transfer credits, and interface with advisory committees.
I am a point person for questions regarding both undergraduates and graduates within the department.

**Program Coordinator, Master of Science in Information Technology Administration and Security** (2020-Current)

As program coordinator, my responsibilities include aligning the MSITAS
curriculum with current industry best practices, ensuring prerequisite
alignment, analyzing student enrollment, and creating and updating working
standards for the program. I work closely with the Office of Institutional
Effectiveness to ensure that we are meeting our assessment and accreditation
responsibilities.

**University Lecturer, Informatics Department** (2019-Current)

As a University Lecturer I have taught IT120 Introduction to Networking, IT420
Computer Systems and Networks, IT490 Systems Integration, IS601 Web Systems,
IT610 Systems Administration, and IT635 Database Administration. I have
developed lab materials for IT120 and IT420 as well as a textbook for IT490. I
serve in the Lecturers and Educators Congress as the representative for the Ying
Wu College of Computing Sciences and maintain/administer the MIXR lab
computers.

**Adjunct Professor, Informatics Department** (2017-2019)

I have taught IT310 E-Commerce Technology, IT420 Computer Systems and Networks,
IT610 Systems Administration, and IT635 Database Administration. My classes are
typically project-based and center around using open source software to solve
real-world problems. All of my classes are infused with practical Linux system
administration and often involve the use of a web framework (Ruby on Rails,
Django, bottle) to create a web application that meet the needs of users.
  
## Monroe Township Schools (Monroe, NJ)

**Educational Technology Facilitator** (2015-2019)

In my role as an Ed Tech facilitator I worked in eight different schools throughout
the district with teachers and students from Pre-K to 12th grade. I aided teachers
in the usage of technology in the classroom and worked to resolve IT related issues
as they occur. This role included the administration of several databases, debugging
and troubleshooting of IT services, development of in-house resources, and the 
provision of technology expertise to aid in district decision-making.

A large portion of my work included helping administration inform their decisions
with data. I utilized data visualization tools (Jupyter/iPython notebooks) as well as
frameworks for data processing (MapReduce / Pandas) to provide insights that drove
district decision making. I also trained teachers and admin on how to perform their
own analysis from the district level down to individual student goal setting.

As my duties were so varied, I strove to automate and document as much as possible.
I created projects to assist in data upkeep responsibilities which primarily
involved web-scraping / creating in-house APIs for web applications with asynchronous
python (aiohttp) or utilizing a controlled browser session (selenium, phantomjs,
casperjs) when Javascript needs to be run client-side. I developed an entire framework
to pull information from the student information system through its reporting facilities
and create a secondary database with an SQLAlachemy ORM. This allowed me to develop
programmatically complex queries that were otherwise unsupported by the system.

**Interim Science Department Coordinator** (2015)

As High School Science Department Coordinator my role consisted of being an
interface between administration, parents, and teachers as well as budgeting and
assisting in day-to-day operations of the department.

**STEM High School Teacher** (2006-2015)

At the High School level I have taught Physics, Chemistry, Introduction to Forensic
Science, Biotechnology Concepts, and Advanced Conceptual Science. I have also
developed several curricula in these areas.

While teaching I have continually developed and utilize educational games in the
classroom. These included a set of tools called Interactive Kinematic Equations which
were developed to teach students how to solve equations using Javascript and HTML5.

## Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA)

**Research Assistant** (2004-2005)

As a research assistant at Applied Materials, I developed a system for measuring
temperature effects on experimental semiconductors. I created a software library to
interface with a thermoelectric cooler and a front-end program to allow an operator
to perform tests. The library I designed was written in C and linked as a Dynamic Link
Library to a front-end written in LabView.

## Integrated Photonic Systems / Petalogic (Trenton, NJ / Petaluma, CA)

**Research Assistant** (2003-2004)

As a research assistant at Integrated Photonic Systems, my responsibilities included
developing and testing software that used the AutoOptics motion control system to
automate common lab procedures. I performed the duties of a systems administrator, using
custom Linux servers to meet the technology needs of a growing company.
