# Work Experience

## New Jersey Institute of Technology (Newark, NJ)

**Adjunct Professor, Informatics Department** (2017-Current)

I have taught IT310 E-Commerce Technology, IT420 Computer Systems and Networks,
IT610 Systems Administration, and IT635 Database Administration. My classes are
typically project-based and center around using open source software to solve
real-world problems. All of my classes are infused with practical Linux system
administation and often involve the use of a web framework (Ruby on Rails,
Django, bottle) to create a web application that meet the needs of users.
  
## Monroe Township Schools (Monroe, NJ)

**Educational Technology Facilitator** (2015-Current)

In my current role I work in eight different schools throughout the district
with teachers and students from Pre-K to 12th grade. I aid teachers in the usage
of technology in the classroom and work to resolve IT related issues as they
occur. My role includes the administration of several databases, debugging and
troubleshooting of IT services, development of in-house resources, and
providing technology expertise to aid in district decision-making.

A large portion of my work includes helping administration inform their decisions
with data. I utilize data visualization tools (Jupyter/iPython notebooks) as well as
frameworks for data processing (MapReduce / Pandas) to provide insights that drive
district decision making. I also train teachers and admin on how to perform their
own analysis from the distric level down to individual student goal setting.

As my duties are so varied, I strive to automate and document as much as possible.
I have created projects to assist in my data upkeep responsibilities which primarily
involve web-scraping / creating in-house APIs for web applications with asyncrhonous
python (aiohttp) or utilizing a controlled browser session (selenium, phantomjs,
casperjs) when Javascript needs to be run client-side. I have developed an entire
framework to pull information from the student information system through its
reporting facilities and create a secondary database with an SQLAlachemy ORM. This
allows me to develop programmatically complex queueries that are otherwise unsupported
by the system.

**Interim Science Department Coordinator** (2015)

As High School Science Department Coordinator my role consisted of being an
interface between administration, parents, and teachers as well as budgeting and
assisting in day-to-day operations of the department.

**STEM High School Teacher** (2006-2015)

At the High School level I have taught Physics, Chemistry, Introduction to Forensic
Science, Biotechnology Concepts, and Advanced Conceptual Science. I have also
developed several curricula in these areas.

While teaching I have continually developed and utilize educational games in the
classroom. These included a set of tools called Iteractive Kinematic Equations which
were developed to teach students how to solve equations using Javascript and HTML5.

## Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA)

**Research Assistant** (2004-2005)

As a research assistant at Applied Materials, I developed a system for measuring
temperature effects on experimental semiconductors. I created a software library to
interface with a thermoelectric cooler and a front-end program to allow an operator
to perform tests. The library I designed was written in C and linked as a Dynamic Link
Libray to a front-end written in LabView.

## Integrated Photonic Systems / Petalogic (Trenton, NJ / Petaluma, CA)

**Research Assistant** (2003-2004)

As a research assistant at Integrated Photonic Systems, my responsibilities included
developing and testing software that used the AutoOptics motion control system to
automate common lab procedures. I performed the duties of a systems administrator, using
custom Linux servers to meet the technology needs of a growing company.
